        <p>
            Hi, I'm <strong>Parami Pabasara Dassanayake</strong>, a passionate and dedicated graduate with a 
            <strong>Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering</strong> from <strong>NSBM Green University</strong>.  
            My expertise lies in <strong>web development, UI/UX design, and digital marketing</strong>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, I have worked on various small-scale web development projects, refining my skills in 
            designing and building modern, user-friendly websites. However, in the past few months, I have 
            discovered a deep passion for the <strong>marketing</strong> side of the digital world.  
            Combining my technical knowledge with creative marketing strategies has allowed me to craft engaging 
            and visually appealing content that connects with audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the ways I express this passion is through creating newsletters, blending compelling design 
            with insightful content to deliver impactful messages. Below, you can explore some of the newsletters 
            I have designed.
